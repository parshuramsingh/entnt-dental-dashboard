## üìê Architecture & State

- **AuthContext**: Simulates login, user session
- **AppContext**: Holds global state ‚Äì patients, incidents, dashboard data
- **ProtectedRoute**: Wraps pages to restrict based on role
- **Dark Mode**: Controlled via localStorage + Tailwind dark class

üìå Technical Decisions
| Area                      | Decision
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **State Management**      | Used **React Context API** (split into `AuthContext` and `AppContext`) instead of Redux/Zustand to align with the ‚Äúno external libraries‚Äù constraint. State is modular, reactive, and avoids prop-drilling. |
| **Authentication**        | Auth is simulated with hardcoded users, managed in-memory and persisted in `localStorage` to maintain session even on refresh.                                                                              |
| **Data Persistence**      | No backend, so patient records, incidents, and appointments are all stored and updated in `localStorage`. Deep merges and ID management are done manually.                                                  |
| **Routing & Protection**  | Role-based access control is implemented using a custom `<ProtectedRoute>` wrapper. Unauthorized users are redirected with toast feedback.                                                                  |
| **Dark Mode**             | Managed through `localStorage` + Tailwind‚Äôs `dark` mode class toggled on the root `<html>`. Theme toggler uses framer-motion for smooth icon transition.                                                    |
| **Responsive Design**     | Layout is fully responsive: desktop sidebar is sticky and mobile sidebar slides in via `framer-motion`. Mobile hamburger is animated and toggles state across Navbar and Sidebar.                           |
| **Charts & Analytics**    | Chose **Recharts** for animated, interactive revenue visualization. Designed monthly revenue card to support export to PDF (via `html-to-image` + `jspdf`).                                                 |
| **Calendar UX**           | Used `react-big-calendar` with `date-fns` for intuitive appointment tracking. Events are color-coded by status, and custom `eventPropGetter` controls visual theming.                                       |
| **Notifications System**  | New incident triggers **toast alert + audio ping**. Read/unread tracking uses a unique `notificationId` array stored in localStorage.                                                                       |
| **File Upload & Preview** | Uploaded files are previewed using `URL.createObjectURL`, and memory is cleaned on unmount using `URL.revokeObjectURL` to prevent leaks.                                                                    |
| **UI Components**         | Reusable `Input`, `Button`, `Card`, `Table`, and `FileUpload` components live in a `/ui` folder to promote DRY design and fast customization.                                                               |
| **Accessibility**         | All components include ARIA labels and focus rings. Buttons, inputs, and links support keyboard navigation and screen reader roles.                                                                         |
| **Mobile Optimization**   | Navbar and Sidebar are context-aware. Mobile view shows slide-in nav, and even critical actions like Logout and Notifications are reachable on small screens.                                               |
| **Form UX**               | Used controlled components with clear validation states, inline error messages, and form animations for smoother interaction.                                                                               |
| **Toast Management**      | `react-hot-toast` is used for all feedback: login errors, booking success, logout, etc. The toast queue is kept short and uses consistent styling.                                                          |

## üõ† Issues & Solutions

| Challenge | Solution |
|----------|----------|
|  **Dark Mode inconsistencies** across components | Initially, some form elements didn‚Äôt respond to dark mode. Solved by enforcing consistent Tailwind dark utility classes and toggling `document.documentElement.classList`. |
|  **Mobile Sidebar stutter on animation** | On some devices, sidebar animation was choppy. Introduced `Framer Motion`'s `AnimatePresence` + `tween` transitions for smoother entry/exit. |
|  **Notification dropdown overlapping UI** | Notification panel would clip or overlap on small screens. Added z-index and relative parent with `max-height` + scroll to fix overflow issues. |
|  **Calendar display misalignment** on certain dates | `react-big-calendar` sometimes rendered month view with offset. Fixed via custom styling + overriding default calendar padding/margin. |
|  **Uploaded file preview not showing** | File preview failed when file was re-selected after deletion. Fixed by updating the `FileUpload` component to reset file input using `key` prop and revoking URLs properly. |
|  **Chart PDF export cuts off axis labels** | The `recharts` canvas did not render properly in PDF. Used `html2canvas` + adjusted layout box model and width to preserve chart clarity in exports. |
|  **Date-time local input not defaulting correctly** | `min={new Date().toISOString()}` failed due to formatting. Fixed by slicing the string (`.slice(0,16)`) to match `datetime-local` input format. |
|  **Patient ID mapping missing** in notifications | Notifications showed "undefined" instead of patient name. Refactored `getPatientName()` utility to return fallback string like `Unknown`. |
|  **Toast re-triggered on every render** | Toasts fired multiple times due to stale state. Fixed with ref checks and triggering toasts only on fresh unread changes using useEffect dependencies. |
|  **Login redirect delay** | After login, components re-mounted before `user` was available. Solved with conditional rendering and redirect logic only after `user` is set in `AuthContext`. |
|  **Memory leak on image previews** | Browser memory usage increased after repeated file uploads. Handled it by calling `URL.revokeObjectURL()` inside cleanup `useEffect`. |
|  **Repetitive styles** in form components | Multiple forms had repeated Tailwind utility classes. Abstracted reusable `Input`, `Button`, `Modal`, and `Card` components to keep code DRY. |
|  **LocalStorage mismatch** during theme toggle | Theme flickered on initial load. Fixed by reading and applying theme in `useEffect()` at mount before UI renders. |
|  **Overflow issues on smaller devices** | Some tables and charts broke layout. Fixed using Tailwind's `overflow-x-auto` and responsive `min-w` table settings. |
